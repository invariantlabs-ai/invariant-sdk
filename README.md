2. To run tests with coverage run `pytest --cov=invariant`.
3. To run tests with coverage (to also include a HTML report) run `pytest --cov=invariant --cov-report=html`. You can then open the `index.html` file in the `htmlcov` folder in your browser to see more coverage details by functions or classes.
