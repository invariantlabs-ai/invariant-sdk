# Getting Started With Explorer

<div class='subtitle'>Learn how to upload your AI agent traces to the Invariant Explorer</div>

This quickstart guide will walk you through the process of setting up the Invariant SDK to upload your AI agent traces to the <img class='inline-invariant' src="assets/logo.svg"/> [Invariant Explorer](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai). 

You can use Explorer to visualize, analyze, and collaborate on your AI agent traces, as well as compare them with other agents and models.

## 1. Create an Explorer Account

First, navigate to the <img class='inline-invariant' src="assets/logo.svg"/> [Invariant Explorer](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai) and create an account via GitHub Sign-In.

Once you have created an account, go to your [User Settings](https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/settings) and generate an API key.

Make note of your API key, as you will need it to authenticate your uploads. If you're running in a shell, you can export the API key now as an environment variable:

```bash
export INVARIANT_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## 2. Install the Invariant SDK

Next, install the Invariant SDK in your Python environment, by running the following command. See [Installation](installation.md) for alternative methods using different package managers.

```bash
pip install invariant-sdk
```

## 3. Prepare Your Traces and Upload

Now, you can start preparing your AI agent traces for upload. The Invariant SDK then provides a `Client` class that you can use to upload your traces in an Invariant-compatible format:

```python
from invariant_sdk.client import Client

traces = [
    # Task 1: Send an email to mom
    [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Can you send an email to my mom, saying I'll be late for dinner?",
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": "Sending an email to your mom now.",
            "tool_calls": [
                {
                    "type": "function",
                    "function": {
                        "name": "send_email",
                        "arguments": {
                            "to": "mom@mail.com",
                            "subject": "Running late, sorry!",
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
]

client = Client()
client.create_request_and_push_trace(traces, dataset="my-first-dataset")
```

This will upload your traces to the Invariant Explorer under a new dataset named `my-first-dataset`. If the corresponding dataset already exists, the traces will be appended to it.

## Work With Your Traces in Explorer

You can now navigate to the following URL to view your uploaded traces:

```
https://explorer.invariantlabs.ai/<your_username>/my-first-dataset/t/1
```

You can also use the Invariant Explorer to analyze your traces, compare them with other agents, and collaborate with your team.
