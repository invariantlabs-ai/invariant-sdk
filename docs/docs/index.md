<div class='subtitle'>Getting started with the Invariant SDK</div>

The Invariant SDK enables you to share, analyze and collaborate on AI agent traces. It helps you explore the behavior of your AI agents and understand how they interact with their environment. 

This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up the SDK, capturing traces, and uploading them to the Invariant Explorer.

To get started, first install the SDK by following the instructions below:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/invariantlabs-ai/invariant-sdk.git
```
